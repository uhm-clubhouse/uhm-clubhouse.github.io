## Overview 
Finding and learning about student clubs that are available at UH Manoa is a difficult task that the UHM Clubhouse intends to solve. The UHM Clubhouse is an application for students to browse an organized directory of all current student clubs with brief descriptions, meeting information, URL to their websites, contact information, and a few select photos.

## Features
* Three distinct user roles
  * Regular users can enjoy a seamless browsing experience of the directory
  * Club admins wield the power to edit their club's data
  * Super admins play the crucial role of ensuring site content appropriateness and bestowing "club admin" privileges upon chosen users
* Browsing page
  * Filter clubs based on interest areas, such as "athletic," "art," and "music." 
  * A club can belong to multiple interests areas
* Notifications
  * Users receive notifications based on their interest areas
    * New club that matches to their preferences
    * When an existing club adds an interest area relevant to the user
* Admin responsibilities
  * Review site content to ensure it is appropriate
  * Introduce new categories, such as musical tastes, capabilities, and goals
