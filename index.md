## Overview 
Finding and learning about student clubs that are available at UH Manoa is a difficult task that the UHM Clubhouse intends to solve. The UHM Clubhouse is an application for students to browse an organized directory of all current student clubs with brief descriptions, meeting information, URL to their websites, contact information, and a few select photos.
